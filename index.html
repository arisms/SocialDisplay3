          <p>Social display is a prototype that provides visual cues about the mobile user's current activity with the device, which are shown on a display attached to the backside of the mobile device.
          The purpose of this study was to examine the possible social effects of increasing surrounding people's awareness of one's activity on the smartphone.</p>
          
          <p>The prototype was designed through an iterative process of focus groups, and its final design was evaluated through a field trial of using social display in real life situations for 10 days.
          The findings provide insights that can be used for designing technologies aiming to increase activity awareness and enhance social interactions between collocated people.</p>  

          <h2>Prototype description</h2>
            <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Lwo6aq4.png" alt=""></p>

             <p>The prototype consists of a 3.5-inch <a href="http://www.inkcase.com/">E-Ink display</a> attached to the backside of an Android smartphone to which images are transmitted from the smartphone via Bluetooth. The Social Display app identifies the application that is currently running in the foreground of the user's phone and sends an appropriate image to the display, making it possible for people around the user to see which application on the mobile device he is using at the moment.</p>

<p>The user can create different profiles for the app, which can later be activated or deactivated. For each profile the user can select from a list of all the applications that are installed on the phone, which will be shown on the display when being used. The user also adds a picture from his gallery to show on the display when the phone is inactive, or when one of the non-selected applications is used. If a profile is set as active, it is automatically enabled when the user goes to a specific location (either identified by the WiFi network or the GPS location).</p>

          <h2>Methods</h2>
          <p>The concept was first introduced in a focus group through scenarios and paper-based mock-ups. We explored the perceived opportunities and challenges of the concept with both scenario-based interviewing and by co- designing the visual cues together with the participants.
          The results of the focus group study were used to finalize the design and build the prototype.
          </p>
          <p>To evaluate the prototype, a field trial with 13 participants in a qualitative approach was conducted. For each participant, the study consisted of 10-12 days of using the prototype, with his or her own smartphone.
          At the beginning of the trial, each participant was interviewed about their general attitude and behavior about privacy and their use of smartphones in everyday life, and answered an initial questionnaire regarding their first impressions and expectations of the prototype, as well as their viewpoints on certain privacy-related issues of phone usage.
          In the evening of each day during the trial period, the participants provided answers to a short questionnaire regarding their experience with the social display during that day.
          A second interview meeting was arranged with every participant at the end of the trial period, during which they were asked about their experience and interactions during the study.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>The results imply that the social display has the potential to increase activity awareness and occasionally encourage serendipitous interaction between mobile device users and their collocated family members and friends. Additionally, the social display underlines the user’s activities with their mobile devices, thus raising self- awareness regarding the appropriateness of using mobile devices in different social contexts. The social display was found to encourage its users to be more careful with the usage of their mobile devices, and, before using them, consider ongoing activities around them more carefully.</p>
