  "body": "#Social Display Prototype\r\nSocial display is a prototype which aims to discover the possible effects of increasing surrounding people's awareness of one's activity on the smartphone.\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/Lwo6aq4.png)\r\n\r\nThe prototype consists of a 3.5-inch [E-Ink display](http://www.inkcase.com/) attached to the backside of an Android smartphone to which images are transmitted from the smartphone via Bluetooth. The Social Display app identifies the application that is currently running in the foreground of the user's phone and sends an appropriate image to the display, making it possible for people around the user to see which application on the mobile device he is using at the moment.\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/u180hZr.gif)\r\n\r\nThe user can create different profiles for the app, which can later be activated or deactivated. For each profile the user can select from a list of all the applications that are installed on the phone, which will be shown on the display when being used. The user also adds a picture from his gallery to show on the display when the phone is inactive, or when one of the non-selected applications is used. If a profile is set as active, it is automatically enabled when the user goes to a specific location (either identified by the WiFi network or the GPS location).\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/9gYqS1V.png)   \r\n_The user selects from a list of all the installed applications which will be shown while the profile is active_\r\n\r\n##Academic publications about Social Display:\r\nJarusriboonchai, P., Olsson, T., Väänänen-Vainio-Mattila, K.
